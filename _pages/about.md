Hi! I am a PhD student in the Biology department at the University of Virginia. My work here in the [Schield Lab](https://schieldlab.org/) deals with the population genomics of venom in the speckled rattlesnake complex. The main goal of this research is to get at the fundamental questions about how venom, a complex life-history trait, experiences selective pressure across speciation events. More broadly, I am interested in studying the internal and external pressures on complex adaptive traits, such as venom, and understanding how these traits differ between and within a species. Future work will leverage this body of research to answer questions regarding the coevolutionary response of complex venom resistance in mammalian prey species.

In December 2023, I completed my B.Sc. with honors in Wildlife Biology with a concentration in Conservation Biology and Applied Vertabrate Ecology from California Polytechnic State University, Humboldt. My undergraduate reasearch at Cal Poly Humboldt primarily dealt with the conservation and managment of wildlife along human-wildlife contact zones, with an emphasis on mammals and birds.

During my last summer in undergrad, I was accepted into the Summer Systematics Institute, an NSF-funded REU program hosted by the California Academy of Sciences. Under the supervision of Dr. Edward A. Myers, I developed a research project incorporating mitochondrial DNA and morphometric analyses to identify potentially cryptic species diversity within saw-scaled vipers (genus _Echis_). This project continued to evolve, eventually resulting in my first publication.  

In pursuit of my B.Sc., I also earned two associate's degrees with high honors from Santa Rosa Junior College: an A.Sc. in Natural Sciences, and an A.A. in Social and Behavioral Sciences. These degrees, and the skills I learned while earning them, contribute to the wholistic, multi-faceted approach I take to research. The integration of evolutionry genomics, applied ecology, and conservation management is core to my current and future research goals.

This website serves as a platform to showcase my continuous effort in broadening our understanding of complex adaptive traits, through scientifically-robust research, engagement with collegues and naturalists, and the tireless pursuit of knowledge.
