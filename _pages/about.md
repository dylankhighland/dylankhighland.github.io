Hi! I am a PhD student in the Biology department at the University of Virginia. My work here in the [Schield Lab](https://schieldlab.org/) deals with the population genomics of venom in the speckled rattlesnake complex. The main goal of this research is to get at the fundamental questions about how venom, a complex life-history trait, experiences selective pressure across speciation events. More broadly, I am interested in studying the internal and external pressures on complex adaptive traits, such as venom, and understanding how these traits differ between and within a species. Future work will look at the interaction between rattlesnake venom toxicity and the coevolutionary pressure of resistance in mammal prey species.

In December 2023, I completed my B.Sc. with honors in Wildlife Biology with a concentration in Conservation Biology and Applied Vertabrate Ecology from California Polytechnic State University, Humboldt. My undergraduate reasearch at Cal Poly Humboldt primarily dealt with the conservation and managment of wildlife along human-wildlife contact zones, with an emphasis on mammals and birds.

During my last summer in undergrad, I was accepted into the Summer Systematics Institute, an REU program hosted by the California Academy of Sciences supervized by Dr. Edward Myers. We developed a research project that incorporated mitochondrial DNA and morphometric analyses to identify potentially cryptic species diversity within saw-scaled vipers (genus _Echis_). This research continued during my Honors Thesis, and eventiually became [my first publication](EVENTUAL DOI or LINK HERE). This porject evolved to a comparative study comparing different single-locus delimitation methods and their hhypothesized diversity against the currently recognized taxonomy.  

In pursuit of my B.Sc., I also earned two associate's degrees with high honors from Santa Rosa Junior College: an A.Sc. in Natural Sciences, and an A.A. in Social and Behavioral Sciences from the Santa Rosa Junior College, an institution I attanded after high school enroute to my undergraduate degree. 

These combined, varied experiences provide a multi-faceted approach to my research, integrating conservation biology, evolutionary genomics, and the human element into a variaty of current and future research goals, all focused on improving our understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors contributing the the evolution of complex adaptive traits and the different selective pressures these traits experience in ancient and modern times.
