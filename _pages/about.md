I am a biology PhD student in the [Schield Lab](https://schieldlab.org/) at the University of Virginia. I received my B.Sc. in Wildlife Biology from Cal Poly Humboldt, where I was primiarily interested in conservation biology along human-wildlife contact zones, with a focus on mammals and birds. I also participated in the Summer Systematics Institute, an REU program hosted by the California Academy of Sciences, where I performed morphometric and genomic analyses on saw-scaled vipers (*Echis* spp.) to reveal cryptic diversity within the genus.

Broadly, I am interested in the genomic consequences of coevolution. My current research seeks to describe the complex interactions between fitness traits in a diffusely coevolving predator and prey system, using rattlesnakes (*Crotalus* spp.) and their rodent prey. In this system, predator exploit multiple prey species, and prey are subject to many predators and other selective forces, which may describe the notable complexity of venom composition in snakes and venom-resistance in prey.

I use comparative genomics, population genetics, and molecular assays to describe the recipricol coevolution of venom and resistance wetween ad within species of varying levels of divergence, with the goal of describing how heterogenous landscapes may result in fine-scaled local adpatation of these complex traits to sympatric antagonists.
